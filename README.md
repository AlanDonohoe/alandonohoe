ðŸ‘€ You might not see that many repos here, as they're either private or my work with organisations in their own github repos.

But here's a couple of public repos from other organisations I've worked with:

1. The [Official UrlBox Ruby Gem](https://github.com/urlbox/urlbox-ruby)

  âœ… 100% test coverage (using Minitest) \*
  
  âœ… Fully linted (using Rubocop) \*
  
  âœ… Fully documented
  
  <br>
  
2. The [Official UrlBox Python Package](https://github.com/urlbox/urlbox-python)

  âœ… 100% test coverage (using Pytest) \*
  
  âœ… Fully linted (using Flake8) \*
  
  âœ… Fully documented
  
  \* via Github Actions/CI

Iâ€™m currently working on a side project to help score and quarantine sign up emails: [EmailQuarantine.io](https://emailquarantine.io/). 

This was inspired by my experience of having to rapidly deal with a DoS attack by Russian hackers when I worked at [CoverageBook.com](https://coveragebook.com/)
